*** Paper Wallet for Merchants ***

This project is a fork of bitcoinpaperwallet, which is a fork of bitaddress.org, the original trustworthy
JavaScript powered offline bitcoin address generator. 

This unique paper wallet design is for merchants to display by their point of sale or store windows.
The private key is removed, and cleverly folds over itself to further hide the generated codes.

This generator includes the same pseudo-random key generation as bitaddress.org, as
well as support for creating wallets using "vanity keys", passphrases ("brain wallets")
or even rolling dice or shuffling cards.

As of March 1, 2014, this generator also includes support and designs for making
Litecoin and Dogecoin wallets.

Use the "verify" tab to decrypt a BIP38 password-encrypted wallet, check the
integrity of any private key, or even duplicate an existing wallet by scanning its
QR code.

*** HOW TO USE THIS GENERATOR ***

1) Extract the ZIP file
2) Open up the 'generate-wallet.html' file with your web browser. 
3) If you like you can select a different language or holiday theme
4) Follow the steps for calibrating your printer and then printing
   the front and back of each wallet. Use landscape mode when printing!
   
Rendering and printing seems to work best using: 

   OS X:     Safari or Chrome or Firefox
   Windows:  Chrome or Firefox
   Linux:    Firefox

When using Chrome on Windows, use the Chrome print dialog. Switching to the
Windows system print dialog will produce corrupted/illegible keys.

QR scanning works best using Firefox since Chrome will not access the camera controls
when opening a locally saved HTML file.

*** COMPARED WITH BITADDRESS.ORG and bitcoinpaperwallet.org ***
New design for displaying codes for merchants.

Images and resources have been moved out of the .html file (where they were
base-64 encoded) and into an images directory to make the code easier to review.

All cryptographic functions are verifiabley identical to those in bitaddress.org.
(Run a "diff" between this project and bitaddress.org if you want to be sure.)

*** HOW TO VERIFY THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS DOWNLOAD ***

After downloading the ZIP package for this generator, you should find a file 
named generate-wallet.html.sig which you can use to:

* Verify that generate-wallet.html hasn't been tampered with, and
* Get proof that it really was authored by Entropy Technology.  
The PGP key can be found at https://www.entropytechnology.com/pgp.asc
  
For example, if you have GPG installed, you should be able cd to the appropriate 
directory and type in these two commands:

  gpg --recv-key 36E1D9B6
  gpg --verify --with-fingerprint generate-wallet.html.sig generate-wallet.html 


If you get warnings like "This key is not certified, there is no indication that
the key belongs to the owner" do not worry, this is normal.
